# BackupWorlds lets you toggle which worlds to include in backups
# You can enable/disable the events that will trigger a backup to happen from RunBackupOn
# repeatInterval runs a backup every time X minutes has passed, 0 means disabled
# Messages and announcements can be hidden
# onJoin and onQuit will hide the 'x has joined the server' messages
# opsOnly restricts the /backup command to ops only
# Setting maxInMegaBytes to 0 will provide unlimited disk space
# Setting minimumIntervalInMinutes to 0 will allow concurrent backups
# AutoUpdate will download the latest version from bukkit.org when an Op joins the server
